        <h3>A traditional french omelette.</h3>
        <p>The french omelette requires few ingredients but plenty of technique to perfect.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cold water</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 pinch of cayenne or white pepper, to taste (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the eggs, water and salt together until very liquid and whites are completely blended in</li>
            <li>Heat 1.5 tablespoons of butter in a 9-10 inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>As soon as the butter fully melts, pour in the whisked eggs.</li>
            <li>Stir in a circular pattern, lifting and scrambling the eggs & shaking the pan to keep levelling out the mixture. Stop once the eggs no longer level out.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and use a spatula to move runny eggs to less runny spots, aiming for an even thickness.</li>
            <li>As soon as the surface is wet but not runny, remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Use the spatula to roll the omelette into a cylinder. Use the spatula to fold the last flat of egg over the top, leaving seam side up.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining butter to the pan, gently push melted butter under the omelette.</li>
            <li>Dust with cayenne or white pepper.</li>
        </ol>
